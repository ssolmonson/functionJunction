def narcissistic( value ):
    # Count number of digits
        # Store as a variable
        # if number of digits equals 1 return True
        # else store number as variable
        
    # Split digits
    # Loop 
        # Each digit is calculated to the power of the numOfDigits variable and added to the next
        # Or multiply it against itself for the number  (could loop this)
        
    # Then compare looped value to original value and return true or false
    return False # Code away
